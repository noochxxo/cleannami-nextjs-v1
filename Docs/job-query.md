## ðŸ“„ Documentation: Job Details Query Module

This server-side module provides a single function to fetch all comprehensive data related to a specific job. It is designed to populate a detailed Job View page, consolidating information from the job itself, the property, the customer, assigned cleaners, and all payment/evidence records.

-----

### **`getJobDetails(jobId)`**

Fetches a single job record along with all related customer, property, subscription, cleaning staff, evidence, and payout information.

#### **Signature**

```typescript
export async function getJobDetails(jobId: string): Promise<JobDetails>
```

#### **Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `jobId` | `string` | The unique ID of the job to retrieve. |

#### **Relational Data Included (`with` clauses)**

The function eagerly loads the following related data to minimize database queries:

| Relationship | Details Eagerly Loaded | Key Information Included |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`property`** | The property where the job took place. | Basic customer ID/info, **latest checklist file** for reference. |
| **`property.customer`** | The customer who owns the property. | ID, name, email, and phone number. |
| **`subscription`** | The subscription under which the job was scheduled. | All subscription fields. |
| **`cleaners`** | All assigned cleaners for this specific job. | Cleaner ID, full name, contact info, and status/reliability metrics. |
| **`evidencePacket`** | The proof-of-completion packet submitted by the cleaner. | All evidence packet fields (if one exists). |
| **`payouts`** | All payout records created for this job. | Payout amount, status, and the name of the cleaner who received the payout. |

#### **Client-Side Calculations**

The function performs several utility calculations on the raw data before returning the final object:

  * **`totalPayout`**: The sum of all `amount`s from the `payouts` records, formatted to two decimal places.
  * **`hasEvidencePacket`**: A simple boolean flag (`true` if `evidencePacket` is present, `false` otherwise).
  * **`isPayoutComplete`**: A boolean indicating if the job has at least one payout record, and **all** associated payout records have a `status` of `'released'`.

#### **Returns**

A promise resolving to the enhanced **`JobDetails`** object. Throws an `Error` if the `jobId` does not match any record.
