## ðŸ“„ Documentation: `createValidatedPaymentIntent`

This server-side function is responsible for securely calculating the final price for a service booking, validating that price against a client-provided amount, and creating a **Stripe Payment Intent** for the first payment. It also manages the creation or retrieval of the Stripe Customer record associated with the user.

-----

### **Overview**

  * **File Context**: This is a **Server Action** or server-side function (`"use server"`). It is called when a user is ready to proceed to the payment step of a booking or signup process.
  * **Security Focus**: The primary security measure is the **server-side recalculation and validation of the price**. The amount sent from the client is checked against the authoritative price calculated on the server to prevent manipulation.
  * **Dependencies**:
      * **Stripe Node.js Library**: To interact with the Stripe API.
      * **`PricingService`**: A local service to handle the complex pricing logic.
      * **Drizzle ORM (`db`, `customers`)**: To query the local database for an existing Stripe Customer ID.

### **`createValidatedPaymentIntent(formData, clientSideAmount)` Function**

An asynchronous function that validates the service price and creates a Stripe Payment Intent.

#### **Signature**

```typescript
export async function createValidatedPaymentIntent(
  formData: SignupFormData,
  clientSideAmount: number
): Promise<{ clientSecret?: string | null; error?: string }>
```

#### **Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `formData` | `SignupFormData` | The validated data collected from the user's booking/signup form, containing service details (e.g., beds, baths, address, services). |
| `clientSideAmount` | `number` | The total payment amount (in **cents**) calculated and displayed on the client side. This is used for a security check. |

#### **Returns**

A Promise that resolves to an object containing either the Stripe client secret or an error message.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`clientSecret`** | `string \| null` | The secret key required by Stripe.js on the client to confirm the payment. Only present on success. |
| **`error`** | `string` | A user-friendly message explaining why the payment intent could not be created. Only present on failure. |

### **Step-by-Step Process & Security**

The function executes the following critical steps:

1.  **Server-Side Price Calculation**:

      * It calls **`pricingService.calculatePrice(formData)`** to determine the *true* and authoritative price of the service based on the provided form details.

2.  **Price Validation (Security Check)**:

      * The server-calculated price (`serverAmountInCents`) is compared against the amount received from the client (`clientSideAmount`).
      * **If the amounts do not match**, the process immediately stops and returns a security error. This protects against users attempting to tamper with the price on the client side.
      * It also checks that the price is greater than zero to prevent invalid payments.

3.  **Stripe Customer Management (Idempotent)**:

      * **Local Database Check**: It first queries the local `customers` table using the user's email to see if a **`stripeCustomerId`** already exists.
      * **Stripe API Lookup/Creation**:
          * If a local ID exists, it retrieves and **updates** the customer in Stripe with the latest name/phone information.
          * If no local ID, it checks Stripe for an existing customer using the **email address**.
          * If no customer is found in either place, a **new Stripe Customer** record is created.
      * This ensures all payments are associated with a single, up-to-date customer record in Stripe.

4.  **Payment Intent Creation**:

      * A new **Stripe Payment Intent** is created using the **server-validated amount** (`serverAmountInCents`) and the ID of the managed Stripe Customer.
      * **Metadata** containing key details from the `formData` (e.g., address, service details, subscription term) is attached to the Payment Intent. This is crucial for logging, fulfillment, and post-payment automation.
      * `automatic_payment_methods: { enabled: true }` is set to ensure the Intent supports various payment methods (e.g., cards, wallets).

5.  **Success Response**:

      * Upon successful creation, the function returns the `paymentIntent.client_secret`.

6.  **Error Handling**:

      * A `try...catch` block handles any API or network failures during the process, returning a generic, user-friendly error message while logging the detailed error to the console.
